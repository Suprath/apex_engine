# Project Apex v1.0.0

## Universal JIT-Accelerated Vector Engine
### 656M+ Aggregate Throughput | Sub-Microsecond Deterministic Latency

Project Apex is a high-performance, deterministic execution engine designed for extreme throughput and ultra-low latency in production environments. Built on runtime code generation (AsmJit), portable SIMD (Google Highway), zero-copy IPC (iceoryx), and schema-driven serialization (FlatBuffers), Apex targets **1B+ Records Per Second per core** on server-grade silicon; currently achieves **656M+ RPS aggregate** on mobile ARM64 (Apple M3). Deterministic processing latency: **sub-microsecond per 64-record vector**.

## Key Features

### Performance Metrics
- **Throughput**: 656M+ records per second aggregate (Apple M3 Air); targets 1B+ per core on AVX-512 server hardware
- **Latency**: ~100 nanoseconds per 64-record vector (JIT kernel: ~20ns, bit-slicing: ~80ns); deterministic, sub-microsecond
- **Memory**: Fixed-size, deterministic footprint; no garbage collection in hot paths
- **Determinism**: Platform-independent results via fixed-point arithmetic and branchless logic

### Architecture Pillars
- **Zero-Copy IPC**: Eclipse iceoryx memory fabric for inter-process communication without serialization overhead
- **JIT Code Generation**: AsmJit runtime compilation for expression evaluation, optimized per schema
- **Portable SIMD**: Google Highway for vectorized bit-slicing and matrix transpose operations
- **Schema-Driven**: FlatBuffers for zero-copy data access and automatic code generation

### Ultra-Low Latency Directives (ULL)
All hot-path code follows four mandatory principles:

1. **Zero Heap**: No dynamic allocation in transaction processing
2. **Branchless**: Bitwise logic and conditional moves (cmov) instead of branches
3. **Cache-First**: 64-byte alignment for L1D cache line efficiency
4. **Fixed-Point**: Integer-only arithmetic; no floating-point operations

## Development Philosophy

All code in hot paths is held to rigorous performance standards. See `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed ULL directives and profiling best practices.

### Key Principles
- **Determinism Over Convenience**: Fixed-point arithmetic ensures identical results across platforms
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Cache alignment, register allocation, and memory layout are explicit in code
- **Measure Before Optimizing**: Profiling and microbenchmarks guide all optimizations
- **No Abstractions in Hot Path**: Inlining and unrolling are preferred over generic code

## Performance Targets & Guarantees

| Metric | Current (M3 Air) | Server Target | Validation |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Throughput | 656M+ RPS aggregate | 1B+ RPS per core | `benchmarks/throughput_*` |
| Latency (per vector) | ~100 ns (64-record) | < 100 ns deterministic | `benchmarks/latency_histogram` |
| Memory Footprint | Fixed, predictable | Fixed, predictable | No heap allocation in hot path |
| Determinism | Platform-independent | Platform-independent | Fixed-point arithmetic, branchless logic |

**Hardware Environment Note**: Benchmarks conducted on Apple M3 Air (4P + 4E cores) inside Docker. Native Linux performance on server-grade silicon (AMD EPYC 64-core, AVX-512) is expected to exceed these figures by 2x-3x, bringing aggregate throughput toward the 1B+ per-core target.
